# MoldiyECS
 
MoldiyECS is a multi-threaded entity comment system (multi-threaded ECS) written in java. The frame work is inspired by artemis-odb (https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) and ashley (https://github.com/libgdx/ashley). Also, the project uses LibGdx (but only because of the pool class xD) (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx)
